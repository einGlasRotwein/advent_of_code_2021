Solving the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in R.

Here is a little "radar plot" for the submarine on day 2.

```{r, out.width='90%'}
radar_plot
```

For day 5, I plotted the hydrothermal vents.
The colour scheme was inspired by the first picture in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent#/media/File:Champagne_vent_white_smokers.jpg), and I used the package [ggecho](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2019/03/22/ggecho-an-experimental-ggplot-stat-for-blurring-elements/) to blurr the lines of the plot, because I thought that this is what represents the smoke of the vents best.

```{r, out.width='90%'}
vent_plot
```
